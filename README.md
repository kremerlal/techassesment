Technical assessment for a job application. The assignment was:


Case Question: You are an analyst for [redacted] supporting an engagement with the Deputy Program
Executive Officer for Ground Combat Systems who oversees the Department of Defense (DoD)
ground combat systems program portfolio. The client is examining the federal government's prior
investments in various ground combat systems (GCS) programs for potential contracting inefficiencies
or opportunities for future investments.

The client would like [redacted] help to illuminate what the Department actually spent on major GCS
programs, specifically, the Abrams tank (e.g., M1A1), Bradley fighting vehicle (e.g., M2A1), and Stryker
armored personnel carrier (e.g., M1130). The client wants an analysis of FY16 through FY20 federal
contract data for these programs that summarizes prominent vendors, funding/contracting offices,
agencies, and outlines of key technologies, products, and services acquired. Additionally, the client
would like to understand what future acquisitions for each of these programs may look like given
where they are in their life cycles, and what potential risks may be associated with the management of
the programs.
